		<h3>Dungeons and Dragons</h3>
			<p>
				The core mechanic of this game, random "dice" rolls, is inspired by Dungeons and Dragons.
				Almost every random element is governed by a random number generator between 1 and 20. This 
				mirrors the famous 20-sided die (d20) often seen in DnD games. In addition to the numbers, 
				many rolls involve a special effect when either a 1 or a 20 is rolled.

				After listing these out, I realized I didn't include many bonuses for rolling a 20. Sorry adventurers!

		<h3>Dungeon Crawler Games</h3>
			<p>
				"Dungeon crawlers" and the like have been a somewhat niche, but consistently represented genre in video
				games.
			</p>
			<p>
				The game I thought about the most was <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/262060/Darkest_Dungeon/">
				Darkest Dungeon</a>. I was really tempted to put some quotes in reference to it, but I thought that they
				may have been too Lovecraftian for this simple dungeon. Thankfully, my game isn't quite as difficult as
				Darkest Dungeon (although there was one time I rolled 1 on room generation 3x in a row and died immediately...).

			<p>
				Other dungeon crawlers I thought about included: Etrian Odyssey, Rogue Legacy, Crypt of the Necrodancer, etc.
				This is nowhere near a comprehensive list of good dungeon crawlers. In fact, it only includes games where the 
				majority of gameplay takes place in dungeons.

					games themselves are very light on story, focusing more on mechanics and old school RPG gameplay. A main 
					feature of the series is drawing your own maps. Add on unforgiving battles and roaming boss monsters and
					you have a recipe for a game for experienced dungeon crawlers.</em>

			<p title="Look at me, I play games">
				Dungeons are an important component of many RPGs and MMORPGs. Some RPGs include: Legend of Zelda, Pokemon 
				(Mystery Dungeon), Fire Emblem Echoes, Bloodborne, etc. 
			</p>
			<p id="paraRPG" title="Mabinogi is probably my favourite MMO. Too bad the population is dwindling (and it's getting old)...">
				In addition, almost all MMORPGs include some form of dungeon exploration (e.g. Mabinogi, Runescape, Dragon Nest, etc.).
				Mabinogi was actually the original inspiration for this game. Each dungeon has this main entrance, and the basic
				structure is composed of monster rooms and treasure rooms.

	<h3>Unlucky rooms</h3>
	<p>
		There were originally going to be more variations of the unlucky room, apart from the
		current pit of spikes. Unfortunately (or fortunately), I decided my time would probably
		be better spent studying for the midterm. Here were some potential rooms:

	<table id="unlucky">

			<th>Room</th><th>Reference</th>

			<td>Pit of spikes</td><td>N/A (it's just a pit of spikes)</td>

		<h2>Detailed Rules</h2>
			<p>
				I wrote a set of detailed rules before noticing the length limitation on the assignment.
				I didn't want to discard everything else, so here it is.
			</p>
			<h3>Earning gold</h3>
				<p>
					There are two ways to earn gold: defeating monsters or opening treasure chests. The amount of 
					gold earned from monsters depends on the difficulty of the monster
				</p>
				
				<h3>Navigating the dungeon</h3>
				<p>
					The dungeon contains three room types: monster rooms, treasure rooms, and "unlucky" rooms.
					You will advance to a random room by pressing the continue button after taking an action in 
					the current room.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Combat</h3>
				<p>
					When you encounter a monster, you may choose to fight or run. If you choose to fight, you must
					roll higher than a number that depends on the difficulty of the monster. As you level up, it may
					become easier to defeat enemies you previously struggled against.
				</p>
				<p>
					The consequences of	losing a fight also depends on the monster level. The difficulty of	running 
					from a monster is constant, but turning your back to the enemy can have fatal consequences.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are four different levels of monsters. As you gain experience and venture deeper into the
					dungeon, the chance of encountering a dangerous enemy increases.
				</p>
				<h3>Treasure</h3>
				<p>
					Monsters aren't the only thing that can be found in a dungeon. Many adventurers are drawn to the 
					dungeon, lured in by the promise of treasure. If you're lucky, you may find gold and rare
					healing potions in treasure chests. However, all that glisters is not gold. Many treasure rooms
					conceal dangerous traps, which may prove fatal to a clumsy adventurer.
				</p>
				<h3>Leveling</h3>
				<p>
					You will gain experience as you brave the trials of the dungeon. At certain experience thresholds,
					you will level up, improving your hardiness and combat ability. Each level you gain increases your
					maximum HP by 2 and reduces the required combat rolls by 1. Leveling up also heals you completely.
					Try to keep an eye on your HP and EXP when making decisions!
				</p>
				<h3>Ending the game</h3>
				<p>
					The game can end in two ways: death or retreat. When you hit 0 HP, your character dies and the game
					immediately ends. Alternatively, you may decide to retreat from the dungeon after clearing a room.
				</p>
